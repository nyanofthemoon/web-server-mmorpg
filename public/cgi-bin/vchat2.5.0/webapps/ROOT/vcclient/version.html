The default settings of most Web browsers will pick up thenew version automatically, but sometimes proxy servers or incorrectsystem clocks can get in the way.</p><h4>Solution</h4><p>Try entering through the VolanoChat applet below:</p><!-- Note to the VolanoChat Administrator:Replace the codebase attribute in the applet tag below with a newabsolute Web address for this directory so that the new version of theapplet will be loaded through any caching proxy servers.  For example,if your normal codebase is a virtual directory (on Windows) or asymbolic link (on UNIX) like the following:  <applet codebase="http://www.yourdomain.com/vcclient" ...change the codebase to point to a new virtual directory or symbolic linkwith the version number included, like this:  <applet codebase="http://www.yourdomain.com/vcclient2.5.0" ...The modified codebase will force the new VolanoChat applets to be loadedthrough any caching proxy servers that might otherwise be serving theold applet to your Web visitors.--><applet codebase="." archive="COM/volano/VolanoChat.jar" code="COM.volano.VolanoChat.class" width="500" height="60"><param name="scriptable" value="false"><param name="cabbase" value="COM/volano/VolanoChat.cab" /><param name="color" value="#ffffff" /><param name="text" value="english.txt" /></applet><h4>If that didn't work ...</h4><p>If entering through the applet on this page didn't work, you can tryeach of the following suggestions to fix the problem yourself.</p><ol><li><p>Close all your Web browser windows, restart your browser, and returnto this Web site. That will usually cause your Web browser to fetch thelatest version of the Java applet from the Web site if it fails to do sonormally.</p></li><li><p>If restarting your browser didn't work, do a <i>forced reload</i> ofthe previous page with your Web browser. In Internet Explorer, go backto the previous page and hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the F5key (the Ctrl-F5 keyboard shortcut). In Netscape, you can do the samething by holding down the Shift key while pressing the Reload button.That should force your Web browser to pick up the new version of theapplet from the Web site.</p></li><li><p>If restarting your browser didn't work, delete your Web browser'stemporary Internet files, thereby removing the old version of the appletand forcing your browser to load the new version.</p><p>In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu at the top of the windowand select Internet Options. Under the Temporary Internet files sectionof the General tab, click the button labeled Delete Files. Select thecheck box "Delete all offline content" and then click the OK button.While you're there, press the Settings button under Temporary Internetfiles and make sure that "Automatically" is selected for the heading"Check for newer versions of stored pages."</p><p>In Netscape, click the Edit menu at the top of the window and selectPreferences. Click the arrow next to the Advanced section to open it andthen select Cache. Press both the Clear Memory Cache and Clear DiskCache buttons. While you're there, make sure that "Automatically" isselected for the heading "Compare the page in the cache to the page onthe network."</p><p>If you're using the Sun Java Plug-in, delete its temporary Internetfiles by right-clicking the Java Console icon in your System Tray at thelower right corner of your screen, selecting Show Console, and thenpressing the "x" key (x: clear classloader cache) in the Java Consolewindow. After you see "Clear classloader cache .... completed," pressthe Close button.</p></li></ol><p>If even that didn't work, you might be trying to do one of thefollowing (which won't work no matter what you do):</p><ul><li>trying to enter a personal chat room with the MyVolanoChat applet ina VolanoChat server that does not support personal chat rooms, or</li><li>trying to enter anonymously in a VolanoChat server that isrestricted to members only.</li></ul><hr /><span class="footer">Copyright &copy; 1996-2002 Volano LLC.
