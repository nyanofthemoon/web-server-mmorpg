Emeralds, the royal jewel, flow, enhancing windows, walls, statues and even trees. Dogs have emerald necklaces, cats have emerald crowns. The mayor bought, at the royal jewelry, a pair of emerald glasses. Thieves from all over the world are caught stealing ornements, bushes and kidnapping wandering animals. Lucky Greengoldians! This kind of attention pleases the king, who dispatched hundreds of royal guards to the village to secure the emeralds.
