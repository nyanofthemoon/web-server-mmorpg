Plain coyotes, wolves and fei hyongs have the bad habit of visiting the town when passing by. Coyotes eat sheeps, wolves eat cows and fei hyong steal goods. That is why three watchtowers have been erected on each hill and a fortified wall has been built between two hills, in the opening. If you don't have sharp teeth, howl or steal, you shouldn't have any trouble entering.
