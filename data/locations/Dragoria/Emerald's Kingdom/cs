MirwoodwoodnM0none068233329searchvar18211*******Mirwood is full of wolves, bears, coyotes and giant bats. Only the bravest will wander here, or anybody with a death-wish. Ever heard about the boy who cried wolf? If he ever existed, he probably lived here. The reputation of these parts is so invasive, travelers think they see monsters everywhere; the thing is, when you yell "Bear!" or "Wolf!" whenever an animal or noise crosses your sight, your companions will laugh at you until you say the truth. Caution should be taken here, and staying calm can also help .
