Raging flower fieldfieldnM0none068323501searchvar1.411060*******In this field, flowers can definitely be a danger. Not the daisies or the wild roses, but the carnivorous plants variety. More than a dozen different species of these plants can be found here, but only three are dangerous. One of them is so big it could eat four men at once! The two others have acids so concentrated  that if your foot or arm gets snatched by one, you will be missing a few parts.
