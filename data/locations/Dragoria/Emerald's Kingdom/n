It is here that the mighty Greengold Battleships are constructed, though in very small numbers. Each of these battleships could destroy up to ten other battleships, dragonstonian, diamondian or topazian. The Royal Emerald Fleet holds one hundred Greengold vessels and about two thousand battleships, smaller and weaker than regular battleships, yet more manoeuvrable. Despite the impressive number, it is less impressive than other fleets. Compared to other fleets with equal numbers of ships, the Royal Emerald Fleet is almost unbeatable.
