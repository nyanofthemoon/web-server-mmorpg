Incapable of producing its own equipment, the kingdom had to raise its taxes in order to initiate a massive military operation. The capital is now buried under weapons, armors and provisions. The main consequence is that it is hard to buy anything in the entire kingdom since all ressources have already been taken. The King of Emerald is the founder of the Ruby Alliance. Concerned about the topazian forces and the independance wish of Diamond, he dispatched all of his ten knights to the four corners of Dragoria to calm down Diamond pulsions, sabotage topazian operations and support Dragonstone in its fight for order.
