Public amusers and musicians can be found in the public market, swallowing knives, juggling with torches, spitting fire and playing the most fascinating and the most classic instruments. Only a small neighbourhood is an exception to the general mood. The dark streets seem to hide lurking thieves and assassins. A strange man dressed entirely in black is said to wander there, unconscious about the surrounding danger or mastering it. A small reward is awarded for his capture. If ever you can catch him, guards are willing to pay you in gold.
