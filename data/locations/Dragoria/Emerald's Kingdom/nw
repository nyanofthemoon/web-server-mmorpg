An enchanted moment in an enchanted field: the legend of the Greengold meadow is a very popular tale. If you are patient enough to lie down a few hours on a sunny day, you should see, sometime during your dreamy observation, a sun-shaped cloud coming from nowhere. This white sun will replace the other one, turning the bright light into a dark pink omnipresent light. Your immediate surroundings appear to be of natural color but further away objects have a purple glow to them. You'll only hear the wind, and voices other than yours will be unclear. Then, the meadow's soul will talk to you, revealing the secret of Greengold.
