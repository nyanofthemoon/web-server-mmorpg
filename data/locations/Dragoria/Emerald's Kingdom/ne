Amuck rainforestrainforestnH0none069933560searchvar0.97138*******The Amuck forest is the closest place to pearlian territory in Emerald, therefore, to the topazian forces. Eventhough it doesn't rain all the time one always feels soaked. In fact, you are soaked, head to feet. Anytime you touch a leaf, it showers its water on you. Knowing this, you should try not to bump into a tree. When you move forward, you keep seeing things move, but when you stop to investigate, you can't find anything. Travelers believe there is a secret military headquarter here, established to counter topazian invasions in this sector. Even if your eyes can't confirm it, this impression of being observed remains overwhelming.
