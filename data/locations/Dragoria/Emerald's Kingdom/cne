Hyphal's jewel shopjewelshopnM0none469413491searchvar1.97233*******Hyphal is a very old elf. In fact, nobody claims to know how old he is, not even him! A small, pointy beard stretches his chin, as white as snow. It might be the first and only time you see a bearded-elf in your entire life, unless, of course, you are immortal. The jewelry here is quality work. Some of them took Hyphal decades to achieve. Swords, daggers, rings, earrings, bracelets, teeth, armors, shields, coins, dice, any possible thing you want, he can make and sell you, if you are increadibly rich.
