It initiated the entire realm's refusal to do so, leaving Topaz alone at war and at the same time improving its stand with Ruby. Dragoncrystal goods are now welcomed in rubyan territory; however, Dragoncrystal is not in good terms with Topaz, who ended his trade treaties with the Realm and removed all of his diplomats from dragoncrystalian land. Kole expects some kind of retaliation from Topaz and is preparing physically and mentaly to meet with the huge force.
