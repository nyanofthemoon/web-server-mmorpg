At first glance you might not recognise the reason   why it has obtained its reputation  but when you look longer, it becomes obvious. The main street, leading to the town center and the town hall, is entirely lined with dragon scales. As you look further and longer, you also notice that people here all wear dragon teeth, either as necklaces or as bracelets.
