You might need a horse to visit it, but hardcore travellers will enjoy the challenge of a complete tour. The splendor of Tyralira can be noticed here, there and everywhere, in the crowded streets and in bakeries perfumed with delicious smells; an unmatched panoramic view is provided by watchtowers spread along the way.
