Its powers are limitless if combined to the Dragonstone. Together, the two relics would generate enough energy to match the power of all dragons, reunited. No one knows which shape this Dragonforce (the energy produced by the two united relics) will take. Maybe blacksmiths will be able to forge it into a weapon or armor, maybe alchemists will be able to make potions with it or maybe it will remain as it is presently. The Dragoncrystal lies in the court, beside the throne. The actual master of the realm, Dravv, is the owner. If you should try to get hold of it, remember that it only beholds power when used with the Dragonstone and that Dravv is not interested in parting with it at the present. If he were in need of money or at war he might consider it, but it is not the case.
