During the Stone War (a war similar to the one occuring in this era), an impressive war machine, the Wall of Swords, was used by the Pearlians and disappeared after the war. It is written in the history books that this incredible war machine was an extremely long wall, all in mithril, about one league long, mounted on four thousand mithril wheels. At each wheel, there was a mithril arm going all the way from the wheel's center to the two meters high top of the wall. The other end of the arm was attached to a horizontal pole on which five one meter and a half long swords were forged. The pole would go up and down, as fast as the machine would go. Perpendicular mithril poles were disposed in a way that four thousand horses could push on the wall. If you understand its mechanism, you can imagine the power of this weapon. If not, you can imagine the value of the machine. Good treasure hunting!
