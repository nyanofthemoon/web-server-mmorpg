When the Stone War ended, this high lord apposed his seal on the peace treaty, a peace Dragoria worked so hard to install. Capital of the chaos zone, it unfortunately continues to witness war after war. Axford's descendants are desperate to see the end of the territory disputes. Massive arrivals of a new breed of adventurers provide numerous reasons to fight. Now, the leaders have causes and tools to help them fight. As new riches are discovered, new ways are found to spend them. A decree has been formulated recently: any form of violence will be prohibited anywhere in the town and all weapons will be  confiscated at the town's entrance. This town has become the only sanctuary in the world which will protect you from anyone.
