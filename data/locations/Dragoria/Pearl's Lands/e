Toulomb has an excellent reputation for its white wines as well. Many red wines were bottled two centuries ago, such as the Toulomb Reserved Abelano crop, which is still maturing. A few other bottles are three centuries old, just about the amount of time it would take you to save enough money to buy one. Only two Abelano bottles remain; apparantly the Toulomb family drank the whole reserve in two months. The Toulomb Reserved Vintelano crop counts a dozen remaining bottles; these specimens were bottled over one thousand years ago, and they are still maturing.
