Village of the Stone DominionvillagenM0none072113404searchvar215000*******The Stone Dominion is one of the least respected military association. Despite its large number of members, this dominion obtains financing and recruits in a barbaric manner: raiding and kidnapping. When the Stone Dominion offered its services to the rubyan forces, even though Ruby was in desperate need of more armed men, it didn't take long before their offer was discarded. Being rejected over and over, the Stone Dominion decided to wait and let their clients come to them instead of the opposite. They invaded this village and killed every soul, stealing everything they could. Realizing they would need a headquarter for potential clients to find them, they claimed this village as their own and renamed it after them. Every "villager" is a member of the Stone Dominion… If you are not here for business or to join them, you shouldn't enter.
