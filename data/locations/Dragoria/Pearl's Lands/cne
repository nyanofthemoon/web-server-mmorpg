Iron towntowndM0none126775163605searchvar0.9694504*06****01*02*The reason why this town is called Iron has changed during the last decade: first, it was because of many iron deposits in the town's soil, but, today, it is because the town is saturated with weapons belonging to criminals haunting it. If you have a death-wish (or you are looking for trouble), sit down at the local tavern, remove your mithril armor and shine it, start counting your gold coins and polish your jewels in front of everyone.
