Crystal castle, Capital of Diamond's KingdomcastlecM0none1234567862663879searchvar1500009*13*normal***04*03*This castle isn't in crystal at all, but it is so rich, it could be! The King of Diamond resides here, but you should ask for an audience long before you really have to see him. His counselors are so protective, not to say paranoiac, that each subject needs to pass as much as five security tests before they can even be considered to receive an audience. Although Diamond is the most powerful kingdom in the Ruby lands, the military meetings never occur in this castle, so it is quite easy to enter without any problems.
