Crossroad of the Grey MountainscrossroadfC0none661573951searchvar1.58962*****02**This crossroad is formed by the intersection of twelve roads. These numerous roads were built to carry weapons and food to the front lines during the Sea War to counter the barbaric invasion. Although these times are long finished, royal soldiers continue to repair and improve them, investing in better chances against a future invasion. You won't find a lot of merchants down here, unless a war is incoming from the West.
