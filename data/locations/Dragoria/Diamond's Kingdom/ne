The mayor, Walterock, is a true leader. If he ordered all his people, women and children included,  to go to arms and fight the topazian forces, it would surely happen. They believe the Kingdom of Diamond should be separated from the Ruby Alliance to form an independant force, and they would be ready to fight Emerald, Dragonstone and Topaz for it.
