This port is the main entrance to the Diamond's Kingdom for Emerald and Dragonstone forces, that is why most of Diamond's army is localised on site. The biggest flag carries the crest of Diamond, cloaking the small red flag of the Ruby Alliance in its shadow. Strange sea monsters have begun haunting these waters, frightening merchants and fishermen; the royal guard is always ready to counter-attack in case of trouble, but they can't be prepared for massive invasions without the help of local mercenaries or adventurers, which they pay healthy sums.
