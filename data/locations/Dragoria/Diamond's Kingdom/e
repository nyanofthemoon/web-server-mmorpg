Most of the cave meshes have been explored and only inaccessible, often too small, paths have been left unsearched. Unless you believe in fate, luck or miracles, you shouldn't waste your time looking for things down there. Greystone citizens don't expect much more than there is to, but they appreciate visitors, so they might try and convince naive adventurers that there might be treasures and relics in the Grey caves.
