The king enjoys life while his soldiers are fighting bravely on the Ruby front, mostly in the Pearl's Lands. Balistas and catapults keep all enemies from coming either from the sea, the land or the air. Giant crossbows, by the hundreds, are mounted on the ramparts. The most powerful force of the continent is directed from this place, discouraging any Topaz enemies the moment they can see the castle. The range of the war machines mounted on Gem is incredible. It will go even further than the eye can see, but what's the use of attacking what you can't see?
