Dawn town, its ancient name, was on the verge of becoming the new relocated capital of Topaz. The mayor decided to invest enormous sums of money in order to insure that the actual town became a "city". He increased the number of residences and shops, broadening the town's territory and buying new lands. The town rapidly gained the title of city, but the relocalisation of the capital of Topaz never occured. Now, the city has heavy debts, but its newly acquired title represents some consolation.
