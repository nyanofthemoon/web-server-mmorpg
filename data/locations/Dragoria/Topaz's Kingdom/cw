Underground Fort of GazogazonM0none12467875853863searchvar1.2523306*09****03*01*Curiously, only two entrances and exits have been built in topazian soil. However, when you enter deep enough, you can see the incredible work of the Gazo workers: an immense chamber has been digged into the solid rock. Dwarves constitute the majority of the population of Gazo, living in the unique and huge fort which is the same size as the chamber. If ever Topaz was in trouble, which is unlikely, it would be easy to defend this fort, rebuilding forces and catching their breathes before a counter-attack.
