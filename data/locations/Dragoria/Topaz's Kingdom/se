Marble quarry of WhitestonequarrynM0none880733576searchvar15067*******Because of the relations between Dragoncrystal and Topaz, marble exportation has been greatly decreased. Whitestone's quarry isn't hiring any more and has started rejecting former workers. Although the marble here looks harsh and pale, the quality of their product isn't the issue at all. The problem is that the war eats up all revenues, leaving almost nothing for luxury goods, like marble. Dragoncrystal was the sole customer Whitestone could rely on since it was not at war and was sound economically. Now, with prices going up only independant buyers can afford it, and they don't appreciate the price raises of Whitestone marble.
