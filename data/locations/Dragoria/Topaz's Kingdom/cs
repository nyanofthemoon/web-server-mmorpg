A stableman and two guards greet you, speaking with the local accent; a vulgar common where orcish expressions disgrace classical phrases. They look pleased with the weather; pigs look very clean compared to Zaldos citizens. Dirty mugs are used by the tavern keepers, and you don't even want to know where the food comes from.
