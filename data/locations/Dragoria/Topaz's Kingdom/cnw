GurdonshireshirenC0none775944019searchvar1.26918******01*This wide shire is composed of hills and dirt roads, essentially. Some cows and horses are grazing in the fields and meadows, but nothing seems interesting otherwise. No villages nor towns in sight, only roads and more grass. Perhaps something is hidden and people don't want to attract attention, but it would be unlikely. Just your ordinary shire under the sun.
