Relations between the two neighbouring nations are worse than ever. Highly diplomatic tensions are mining the negotiation field. Consequently, Retunburg refuses any dragoncrystalian entry, goods and people. If you come from Dragoncrystal's Realm, you should head back to dragoncrystalian soil or head north, where people are friendlier.
