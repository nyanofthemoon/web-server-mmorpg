He was given this freehold not long after he won his first and only battle, commanding five hundred men on the diamondian front. This was the second of the three battles during the Short Peace, and the only one won by Topaz amongst them. Sir Meldor has acquired a modest castle, as modest as his fortune. The main town has a population of three thousand folks, a small town indeed.
