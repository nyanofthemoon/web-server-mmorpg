Bluefaery stew taverntavernnH0none863403127searchvar1.310432*******The owner of the tavern claims to prepare all of his meals and drinks with a dose of Bluefaery water, coming from the Bluefaery fall itself. This belief might not increase the number of his customers, but it must be one of the reasons for his popularity. He got in some trouble with the law when he was suspected of selling plain water at very high prices, claiming it to be Bluefaery water. If you like the food here and have never been to Bluefaery fall, maybe it should be your next stop. Until then, thieves and noblemen will share your company during the length of your stay.
