Village of SilentstonesvillagenH0none1262402922searchvar1.2457002*03******The Silentstones stand on the top of a hill, about one league north of the village. They are called silent because of the muted sound they produce when hit by metal. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that it is the metal which makes little noise when hitting these stones, but popular logic wants it otherwise.
