It isn't recommended to go without tasting their pear juice, if local gossip matters even the least to you. Wildberries grow inside the village, behind  the houses as well as in the streets. A particular variety of wildberry, called horseberry, will enchant you by their looks and your steed, by their taste. The pears come from a pear field, located in the north of the village. Don't talk about the war to the villagers, unless you want to see how nice people can turn to cold people.
