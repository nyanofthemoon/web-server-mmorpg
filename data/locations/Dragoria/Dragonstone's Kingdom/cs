A fortune can easily be lost if you become a Beringon amateur, so maybe you shouldn't even taste it. As a token of gratitude to the grounds which produce such grapes, the Beringon owner gives away his ten best bottles each year to visitors from across the continent, at random. Bonne d&eacute;gustation!
