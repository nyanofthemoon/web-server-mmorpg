His armors are mostly very expensive, but if you order in huge quantities, for an army for example, he will be glad to charge you the best price in the entire kingdom. He is proud to serve clients belonging to the high aristocracy and to royalty, but not much to the mercenaries or adventurers. If you have a lot of money, Tyral's forge might be what you are looking for.
