Plateau of HeltplateaunH0none064573208searchvar0.99326*******The Helt mount is solitary and low. Its tortured shape reminds you of the suffering Dragonstone people are under. This plateau is always unoccupied, unfertile and unlikely to bear life. The main purpose of this plateau is to offer an excellent duel location: no witnesses, open and cold. In other terms, the plateau of Helt is as ugly as it is symbolic.
