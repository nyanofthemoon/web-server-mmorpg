In addition to being overtaxed and mistreated, their once renown voice at the council has been refused by the Grand Council of Dragonstone. Forced to admit Dragonstone has fallen under an unpure monarchy driven by blood instead of leadership, Milen, the mayor, decided to call upon Lord Archibald to start a rebellion. Although this revolution has been initiated, no true rebellion can be recognized yet, since the four other lords have too much military support and too much hate toward Lord Archibald.
