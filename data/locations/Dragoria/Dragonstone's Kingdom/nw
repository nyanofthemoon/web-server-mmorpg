Built on land and tested on sea, its ships are the pride of Dragonstone's Royal Fleet. Although the sailors can't compete with the strenght of Diamond's or Topaz's armies with these ships, they are the masters of Dragoria's seas. Emeraldian battleships are the best, but can't be produced in large enough quantities, therefore making Dragonstone the leader in sea combat.
