Bluefaery fallfallnH0none866793198searchvar15021*******The Bluefaery fall is located in a small wood, near Dregnoughshire. Pure and colourful, rainbows are a feast for the eye. The Blue Faery legend is also memorable. These typical flying creatures would live inside each drop of water. At the feet of the fall, each faery is supposed to return at the top of the fall, making this a two-way running waterfall. Strangely, it isn't rare to hear weird tales from visitors: they claim to have witnessed the legend, therefore having seen the Bluefaeries. Two little girls disappeared near the falls; some say wolves ate them, others say the Bluefaery fall turned them into Bluefaeries. In any case, it would be wise not to go there alone.
