Only a few leagues separate Fythlom from the raging battlefields in Pearl. Fythlomians aren't affraid of the topazian forces, since they are well protected. Their real fear is to see their taxes increase: not only do they pay their royal taxes and their lord taxes, but also a special military tax, being forced to provide food and equipment to the soldiers of Dragonstone.
