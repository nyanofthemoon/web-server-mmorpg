Village of GerardvillagenM0none764623351searchvar18815******01*Lord Gerard of Dragonstone is one of the five lords governing the nation. His native village was renamed after him the same day he took the throne. There aren't many alive to remember the ancient name of this village, since Lord Gerard ordered the royal guards to arrest and burn all of the villagers who would interfere with the "Nation's Will". This fraudulous man hunt ended into a complete massacre, leaving wives and children widows and orphans. Other villagers coming from other parts of the kingdom were deported here in order to repopulate without recreating the rebellious circumstances in which Gerard was drawn into when he ordered the name change.
