Gregory stallions have inherited their name from a recent legend: Gregory was a reknown Blade Master, and he adored horses. When he decided to breed them, a special race was born, the Gregory stallions. Now, if you ever heard of a legend that lame, or even more, you could make money out of it. Maybe that is why people always prefer "old" legends: they had some time to be transformed and enhanced.
